		\href{http://stripe.com}{\textbf{Stripe}} & San Francisco, CA\\
		Site Reliability Engineer & March 2017 - Present\\
	\end{tabular*}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Drove our ``carrot" effort, a tool that scanned Stripe services for reliability risks and made suggestions for teams to improve their reliability
		\item Built an internal dashboard to show which code paths were struggling with availability and followed up with the responsible teams
		\item Designed and implemented a production readiness review process for new services
		\item Reorganized the Stripe post-mortem and incident review process to make sure that we could track metrics from incidents and drive follow-up for remediation items
	\end{itemize}

		Senior Site Reliability Engineer & April 2015 - January 2017\\
	\end{tabular*}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Drove our ``production ready" effort, a checklist of important reliability steps for development teams, and developed a tool that scanned Netflix microservices for reliability risks and made suggestions for teams to improve their reliability
		\item Consulted with microservice teams to drive reliability efforts, including adding monitoring, alerting, deployment practices, application tuning and chaos resiliency. This effort significantly increased the percentage of critical infrastructure teams that had effective monitoring and alerting.
		\item Lead post-mortem incident reviews to identify root cause and ensure remediation and created a new ``after-incident report" process so single page write-ups of incident learnings could be communicated broadly throughout Netflix.
		\item Participated in oncall rotation and incident response, initial triage, ensuring communication and making sure engineering teams were focused on mitigating customer impact during major outages.
